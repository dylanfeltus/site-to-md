How it works

## Write. Publish. Done.

01

### Write your update

Markdown editor with live preview. Draft, schedule, or publish instantly. Or let AI write it for you.

02

### Publish everywhere

One click sends your update to your hosted page, embed widget, email subscribers, and RSS. Everywhere at once.

03

### Own your brand

Your domain. Your logo. Your colors. Automatic SSL. Zero "powered by" badges.

Features

## Thoughtfully simple

Every feature earns its place. No bloat, no feature-gating games.

### Custom domains

Your changelog lives at changelog.yourcompany.com. SSL certificates handle themselves.

### Embeddable widget

One script tag. A clean widget slides out inside your product. Matches your brand automatically.

### Scheduled publishing

Write now, publish when the time is right.

### Categories

Organize updates as New, Improved, Fixed, or custom tags.

### RSS feed

Standard RSS for users who prefer feed readers.

### Markdown editor

Write in markdown with images, code blocks, and more.

### API & CLI

Publish from your terminal, your CI/CD pipeline, or let your AI agents ship updates while you sleep.

Embed widget

## Updates inside  
your product

One line of code. A clean widget slides out when your users click "What's New." Fully customizable, always on-brand.

`<script src="updates.page/embed.js"></script>`
